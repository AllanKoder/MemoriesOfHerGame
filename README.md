Background: 
I made this game for the Waterloo GL Global Game Jam https://globalgamejam.org/2021/jam-sites/university-waterloo
I won the award the Best People's choice by vote. I wanted to mess around with a roguelike and progression system here. I hope you can enjoy the game that was made in 5 days!
